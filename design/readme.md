# what to do:

Create an admin app to add, update, and view customer, product, and order data.
in the schema.  The schema definition can be found in MySQLSampleDatabase.pdf in
this directory.

The goal is to create great, functional, easy-to-use app.  The requirements are 
intentionally open-ended.  Think about how you might use this app,
add features that would make it easier for you to use.  Be creative.  You can
add or update the schema as necessary, use whatever libraries or modules
that make the job easier.

## Basic Use Cases

1. Write a way to search for and view orders
2. Write a form to input a new customer
